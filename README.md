• Planets, including Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, orbit around the sun in a visually engaging manner.

Dynamic Features:

• Planets move dynamically in their orbits, showcasing the orbits of the solar system's celestial bodies.

• Realistic sizes and scaled distances between the planets provide an accurate representation.

Starry Background:

• Added a starry background to enhance the cosmic atmosphere, with stars twinkling in random patterns.

• Stars move downward, creating a continuous cosmic backdrop.

User-Friendly Controls:

• Implemented user-friendly controls for easy customization and adjustments.

• Planets' sizes, orbits, and speeds can be easily modified to suit different preferences.

Instructions for Use:

• The code is well-documented, providing clear instructions on how to run and customize the solar system simulation.

• Users can explore and modify the code to create their own unique solar system visualizations.
